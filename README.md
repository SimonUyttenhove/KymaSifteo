KymaSifteo
==========

The program is designed to use the original Sifteo cubes to play music. 
Each cube has a role and send an OSC message to Kyma Pacarana when is connected to the "source" of the music.

Original cubes are used, so it's working with MonoDevelop, SiftDev and the old SDK. They run with C# whereas the new ones run with C++.
